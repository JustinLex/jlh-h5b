      This Application installs the 1password operator, 
      used for fetching secrets from 1password and distributing them throughout my homelab.
      
      Note that this operator needs 2 secrets in the onepassword namespace, one named "op-credentials", and one named "onepassword-token".
      These should be created by hand through kubectl, as they are generated by 1password, and they are the root credentials giving access to 1password.
      
      op-credentials can be created using the following command:
      kubectl -n onepassword create secret generic op-credentials --from-literal=1password-credentials.json="$(base64 -w 0 ~/Downloads/1password-credentials.json)"
      
      onepassword-token can be created using the following command:
      kubectl -n onepassword create secret generic onepassword-token --from-literal=token=<OP_CONNECT_TOKEN>
      
      This application points to the 1password Helm repo.
      To update 1password to a new major or minor release, change the targetRevision tag to a new release tag.
